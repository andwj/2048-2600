2048 2600
=========

A port of the [2048](1) game to the [Atari 2600].

Because there aren't enough [versions of this game](http://phenomist.wordpress.com/2048-variants/)! :laughing:

## Running

You will need either an emulator (e.g., Stella) or a real Atari with an Harmony cart. In either case, just download [2048.rom](2) and run as a normal Atari game.
