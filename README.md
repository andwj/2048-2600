2048 2600
=========

A port of the [2048][1] game to the [Atari 2600][4].

(because there aren't enough [versions][11] of this game :laughing:)

## Running

### On the Browser

Thanks to [James Friend][34], you can [play 2048 2600 on your browser][35]!

### On an Emulator or a Real Atari

I suggest using [Stella][13], or a real Atari with an [Harmony][14] cart. In either case, just download [2048.rom][2] and run as a normal Atari game.

## Bulding / Development info

All the juicy details are included on [2048.asm][3] (the main source file), and a bit easier to read [on this blog post][12].

## Contributors

- [Ben Combee][40] - Fixed the bug that prevented the last tile from being picked;

## Special Thanks

- [Lucas][30], [Diogo][31], and [Bani][32], for support and suggestions.
- All the nice people at the [AtariAge forum][33], for making lots of information available.

## Pending
### Known Bugs
- Very infrequently we have an extra scanline. Seems to happen when lots of tiles are shifted.

### Things that would be nice

- Animation for new tiles
- Animation for merged tiles
- Counting points
- Time-based multiplayer like [Emil Stolarsky's][6]
- Turn-based multiplayer (survival-style), one or two players
- An easter egg (after all, Atari 2600 [pioneered][5] the genre)
- Different colors for each tile value (this one is **hard**. I've almost
managed to do it, but I'm missing a few cycles to change the colors quick enough)
