2048 2600
=========

A port of the [2048][1] game to the [Atari 2600][4].

(because there aren't enough [versions of this game](http://phenomist.wordpress.com/2048-variants/)! :laughing:)

## Running

You will need either an emulator (e.g., Stella) or a real Atari with an Harmony cart. In either case, just download [2048.rom](2) and run as a normal Atari game.

## Pending Stuff

### Missing for a "1.0" release:


### Feature Creep Corner

- Review scanline counts
- Different colors for each tile value
- Animation for new tiles
- Animation for merged tiles
- Title screen
- Counting points
- Time-based multiplayer like [Emil Stolarsky's][6]
- Turn-based multiplayer (survival-style), one or two players
- An easter egg (after all, Atari 2600 [pioneered][5] the genre)
